# EnderGames

Work in progress Paper plugin that brings back the discontinued EnderGames game mode from the GommeHD server.

## Using the Plugin

Install the plugin as usual on a Paper Server for Minecraft 1.21.4 of your choice. It is advisable to use a new world,
as this can be damaged by the game.
The game can only be started by server operators with the command `/endergames start`, for which all players must first
select a kit with `/endergames kit <kit name>`.
